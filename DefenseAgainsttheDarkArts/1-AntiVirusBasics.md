# Anti-Virus Basics

This section will bring me some heat, because a lot of people in the
security community don't believe that anti-virus is helpful. I disagree,
mostly on the basis that while they only detect lowest hanging fruit
malware, I don't want to be a lowest hanging fruit victim.

Basically, these companies execute the malware, break down the malware
into tiny pieces and creates indicators for the different components and
what the execution of them look like, so that they can identify them on
your computer and completely delete them off. I recommend that you have
Windows Defender running at all times for protection. There is no need
to have any other anti-virus on your computer, more is not better. ***As
an important note, Linux anti-virus is pretty horrible and you should
never install it. It's pretty difficult to get a virus on Linux, but if
you do, let me know so I can RE it.***

The only time I'd recommend you run a second antivirus is to remove an
active adware or PUP infection as Windows Defender doesn't consider many
of them malicious.

2.  Make sure Windows Defender is running, because it is built into your
    computer and is really, really good.
